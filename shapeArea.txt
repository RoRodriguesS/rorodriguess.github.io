Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by 

taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.

So, a n = 2 has area = 5; a n = 3 has area = 13; a n = 4 has area = 25.

int shapeArea(int n) {
    int aux = 1;
    
    if(n == 1){
        return 1;
    }
    else{
        for (int i = n; i > 1; i--){
            aux = aux + ((i - 1) * 4); 
        }
    return aux;
    }
